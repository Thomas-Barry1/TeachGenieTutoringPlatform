## What You Need to Do for Better Sitelinks üéØ

### 1. **Create Missing Landing Pages** ‚ö†Ô∏è **IMPORTANT**
Your sitemap references pages that need to be created:

- **`/subjects`** - List all available tutoring subjects (priority 0.6)
- **`/dashboard`** - Public landing page when not logged in (priority 0.8)
- **`/messages`** - Public messaging features page (priority 0.7)

### 2. **Improve Internal Linking**
Add more internal links between pages to help Google understand relationships:

```tsx
// In your components, add more cross-links
<Link href="/tutors">Find Expert Tutors</Link>
<Link href="/subjects">Browse Subjects</Link>
<Link href="/dashboard">Access Dashboard</Link>
```

### 3. **Add Anchor Links to Homepage Sections**
Update your homepage to include anchor links:

```tsx
// Add IDs to sections
<section id="how-it-works" className="py-16">
<section id="subjects" className="py-16">
<section id="testimonials" className="py-16">
```

### 4. **Optimize Page Titles and Descriptions**
Each page should have unique, descriptive titles:

```tsx
// Example for tutors page
export const metadata = {
  title: 'Find Expert Tutors | TeachGenie - Math, Science, English & More',
  description: 'Browse qualified tutors for all subjects. Book sessions instantly with verified educators. Flexible scheduling and proven results.',
}
```

### 5. **Add Footer Navigation**
Create a comprehensive footer with all main sections:

```tsx
const footerLinks = [
  { name: 'Find Tutors', href: '/tutors' },
  { name: 'Subjects', href: '/subjects' },
  { name: 'Dashboard', href: '/dashboard' },
  { name: 'Messages', href: '/messages' },
  { name: 'Sessions', href: '/sessions' },

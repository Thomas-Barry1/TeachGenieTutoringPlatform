# Session Management Features

## Overview

The session management system has been enhanced with advanced filtering, search functionality, and pagination to improve navigation when dealing with many sessions.

## Features

### 1. Advanced Filtering

#### Time-based Filters
- **Upcoming**: Shows only future sessions
- **Past**: Shows only completed sessions
- **All**: Shows all sessions regardless of date

#### Status Filters
- **All Status**: Shows sessions of any status
- **Scheduled**: Shows only scheduled sessions
- **Completed**: Shows only completed sessions
- **Cancelled**: Shows only cancelled sessions

#### Payment Filters
- **All Payments**: Shows sessions regardless of payment status
- **Paid**: Shows only paid sessions
- **Pending**: Shows only sessions with pending payment
- **Failed**: Shows only sessions with failed payment

#### Subject Filters
- **All Subjects**: Shows sessions for any subject
- **Specific Subject**: Filter by individual subjects (dynamically populated from user's sessions)

### 2. Search Functionality

The search feature allows users to find sessions by:
- **Tutor Name**: Search by tutor's first or last name
- **Student Name**: Search by student's first or last name
- **Subject Name**: Search by subject name

Search is case-insensitive and matches partial strings.

### 3. Pagination

- **12 sessions per page** by default
- **Smart pagination** that shows relevant page numbers
- **Page navigation** with Previous/Next buttons
- **Page information** showing current page and session range
- **Automatic page reset** when filters change

### 4. User Experience Improvements

#### Collapsible Advanced Filters
- **Default state**: Shows only time-based filters (Upcoming/Past/All)
- **Expandable**: Click "Show advanced filters" to access search and additional filters
- **Clean interface**: Keeps the interface uncluttered while providing powerful filtering options

#### Filter Summary
- **Session count**: Shows "Showing X of Y sessions"
- **Clear filters**: One-click button to reset all filters
- **Visual feedback**: Clear indication of active filters

#### Responsive Design
- **Mobile-friendly**: Filters stack appropriately on smaller screens
- **Grid layout**: Sessions display in responsive grid (1-3 columns based on screen size)
- **Touch-friendly**: Large touch targets for mobile users

## Technical Implementation

### Components

#### `SessionFilters.tsx`
- Handles all filtering UI and logic
- Collapsible advanced filters
- Filter state management
- Clear filters functionality

#### `SessionPagination.tsx`

- Smart page number display
- Page information display
- Responsive pagination design

#### `SessionsPage.tsx`

### Data Flow

1. **Initial Load**: Fetch all user sessions from Supabase
2. **Client-side Filtering**: Apply filters using `useMemo` for performance
3. **Pagination**: Slice filtered results for current page
4. **Real-time Updates**: Update session status/delete with immediate UI feedback

### Performance Optimizations

- **Client-side filtering**: Reduces API calls and provides instant feedback
- **Memoized filtering**: Uses `useMemo` to prevent unnecessary recalculations
- **Efficient pagination**: Only renders visible sessions
- **Debounced search**: Prevents excessive filtering during typing

## Usage Examples

### Finding Pending Payments
1. Set time filter to "All"
2. Set payment filter to "Pending"
3. View all sessions requiring payment

### Finding Sessions with a Specific Tutor
1. Use search box to type tutor's name
2. Results will show all sessions with that tutor

### Finding Past Math Sessions
1. Set time filter to "Past"
2. Set subject filter to "Mathematics"
3. View all completed math sessions

### Clearing All Filters
1. Click "Clear all filters" button
2. Returns to default "Upcoming" view

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
1. **Date Range Picker**: Select specific date ranges
2. **Bulk Actions**: Select multiple sessions for bulk operations
3. **Export Functionality**: Export filtered sessions to CSV/PDF
4. **Calendar View**: Visual calendar representation of sessions
5. **Saved Filters**: Save and reuse common filter combinations
6. **Advanced Search**: Search by session notes, price range, etc.

### Performance Improvements
1. **Server-side Pagination**: For very large datasets
2. **Virtual Scrolling**: For extremely long lists
3. **Caching**: Cache session data to reduce API calls
4. **Lazy Loading**: Load session details on demand

## Testing

The filtering logic is tested with unit tests covering:
- Time-based filtering (upcoming/past)
- Status filtering
- Payment status filtering
- Subject filtering
- Search functionality
- Pagination logic

Run tests with:
```bash
npm test
```

## Accessibility

- **Keyboard navigation**: All filters and pagination controls are keyboard accessible
- **Screen reader support**: Proper ARIA labels and descriptions
- **Focus management**: Logical tab order through interface
- **Color contrast**: Meets WCAG 2.1 AA standards
